# Initiative roller

Java practice with ArrayList and HashMap - initiative roller for D&D.

This application rolls initiative for D&D combat and allows the user to re-roll initiative; add, remove, or modify combatants; show the current initiative list, show a menu, and exit the program when done.

All code written from scratch by me. I wrote this application in a few hours to refresh myself on Java syntax and practice using an ArrayList, a Hashmap, and a custom class to create objects before doing a live coding interview.

.java files are in the src folder.

This application has not been debugged and is very easy to break because it was built to do some coding practice before anything else :)
